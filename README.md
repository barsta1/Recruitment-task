# Angular Todo App

This app is a very basic todo app written in Angular. Currently, the app contains lots of issues
and code that did not pass the test of time.

This is really unfortunate, as we eventually aim to scale the project into an enterprise scale product, with multiple teams working on this codebase...

## The Purpose

This app is meant as a refactoring playground for frontend developers that will be given to applicants
to roughly gauge their coding and clean code experience.

## The Content

The app contains two small functionalities.
1. The ability to add, complete and delete todos.
2. The ability to track and add usernames.

Apart from these functionalities, an attempt was started to split these two features into separate 
routes. Unfortunately, the routing doesn't quite work yet.

## The Task

Refactor the app to adhere to modern coding standards. Ideally, the app would also use modern 
angular syntax.

Our product owner also has a couple of requests:
- Please fix the routing.
- Do not change the interface of the todo service. The PO really likes it the way it is. He wrote it himself.
- If you encounter any bugs, please fix them immediately.

The applicants are given a maximum of four hours for this task. Within these four hours, applicants may
allot their time however they wish.

Once done, please send a link to the refactored code as well as
any additional info to the e-mail addresses provided to you.

Good Luck!
